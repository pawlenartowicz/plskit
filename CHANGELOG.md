All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-12

- Added: `spls1_*` sparse PLS1 family (`spls1_fit`, `spls1_find_keep_optimal`, `spls1_find_k_optimal`, `spls1_find_k_sequence`) — hard keep-count NIPALS selection with dense bit-parity at `keep = n_features`.
- Changed (numerical — outputs shift from 0.1.0; pin the version for
  reproducibility):
  - `pls1_find_k_sequence` now standardizes and deflates with the supplied
    observation weights (0.1.0 ran the incremental steps unweighted and only
    weighted the final per-step test).
  - universal-inference e-value (`method="e"`) fixes σ²_alt on the training
    half instead of the test half.
  - χ²(df) survival function computed via the upper incomplete gamma directly
    (no 1 − lower complement round-trip).
  - subsample subspace leverage computed without Procrustes alignment (the
    hat matrix is rotation-invariant).
  - varimax final `w_rot` matmul via faer (`Par::Seq`) instead of a scalar loop.
  - rotation-stability paired-bootstrap seed derived from the parent RNG
    stream instead of a fixed `0xB007` offset.
- R and Julia wrappers remain at 0.0.1 (no `spls1` surface yet).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-09

Initial release of plskit. PLS1 with modern inference (canonical
percentile CIs, `split_nb`, `split_perm`). Ships the Rust engine
(`plskit` on crates.io) and the Python wrapper (`plskit` on PyPI);
R and Julia wrappers are not yet at feature parity and ship at a
lower version.
